## Dining philosophers problem
It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals.
## Difficulties
- Starvation : schedule with a priority queue aging through time
- Mutual exclusion : organize the access so they never access the same point at the same time
- Deadlock : never get stuck into an infinite loop
